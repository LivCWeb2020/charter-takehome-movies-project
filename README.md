# Charter Movie App Takehome

Message for the team: I was having difficulty with the cors errors with the api calls, so I built my own version of the api based on data returned from Postman and deployed with heroku. Then I started to get CORS errors using that. I have yet to find a work around, but once the cors issue is resolved I'll be able to swap out the api endpoint and it should work just fine.

This is a simple movie application that allows users to search movies by genre and title. You can also click on individual films and see details about them. Built using React and Typescript.

## Screenshots
will update with screenshots one cors issue is resolved and details populate properly
